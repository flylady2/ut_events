# UtEvents

Welcome to UT Events!  This is a CLI-based ruby gem that presents information from the events calendar at the University of Texas at Austin.  The user sees a numbered list of events that are happening that day and can obtain additional information such as the event's location, a brief description, type of event or sponsoring institutions, and the url for the individual calendar webpage  for the event.  The user can also ask to see a more detailed description of any event, and to see a list of events corresponding to a particular category or sponsoring institution.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

gem 'ut_events'

And then execute:

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install ut_events
